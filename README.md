**Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
**1 Objective:**
Implement a robust image classification system using CNN to accurately classify images into predefined
categories.
**2 Project Overview:**
Dataset Selection: Utilize the widely used and diverse dataset, such as the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
**Data Preprocessing:**
Resize images to a standard size. Normalize pixel values to ensure consistency. Augment the dataset
through techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to enhance model generalization.
**Model Architecture:**
Design a CNN architecture with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to optimize performance.
**Training:**
Split the dataset into training and validation sets. Train the model using an appropriate optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam) and a suitable loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy). Monitor training
progress, ensuring the model is not overfitting.
**Evaluation:**
Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set to assess its performance. Analyze metrics such as
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
**Fine-tuning:**
If necessary, fine-tune the model based on evaluation results. Experiment with regularization techniques to improve generalization. Deployment:
Integrate the model into a user-friendly application or platform for real-world use.
**Tools and Technologies:**
Python (TensorFlow, Keras)
Jupyter Notebooks for development and experimentation.
